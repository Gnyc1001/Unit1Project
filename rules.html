<h3>Game Rules</h3>
<a href="https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Battleship.PDF">Based on Hasbro Game Instructions</a>

<p>Two players each have a 10 X 10 grid each player.</p>

<p>Each player has 5 ships that can be placed horizon or vertical only.
<br>
<br>Total of 17 hitpoints per side.
<br>carrier is     5 hitpoints
<br>battleship is  4 hitpoints
<br>cruiser is     3 hitpoints
<br>submarine is   3 hitpoints
<br>destroyer is   2 hitpoints
</p>



<p>Game starts off with players prompted to enter their names.  After entered the game builds each player a 10x10 grid.  Player 1 starts by assigning the locations of their ships on the board. This is done by selecting the starting and end coordinates for each ship.  After player 1 assigns all 5 ships of their sheeps (a total of 17 hitpoints), their grid will be covered in a ‘fog of war’ and player 2 is prompted to get ready to assign their ships on their grid.  Once player 2 assigns all their ships, the game covers their grid in a ‘fog of war’ and player 1 will get prompted to start the game.

<p>Player 1 selects a black square on player 2's board, if the square returns a 'hit' a green square will appear. If it is a 'miss' a gray square will appear. Both 'hits' and 'misses' count will appear on below console. After player 1 takes their turn, their grid will be covered with a ’fog of war'. Then player 2 will be prompted to get ready.  Once they accept, they will be able to see their grid but not player 1's grid. The player that sinks all the opponent’s ships ( total of 17 hits) wins!</p>
