Based on the Hasbro’s Battleship board game.
https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Battleship.PDF

each player has 5 ships that can be placed horizon or vertical.  
total of 17 hitpoints per side
carrier is 5 hitpoints
battleship 4 hitpoints
cruiser    3 hitpoints
submarine  3 hitpoints
destroyer  2 hitpoints

Two players have a 10 X 10 grid each player. 


Game starts off with players prompted to enter their names.  After entering their names the game builds each player a grid.  Player 1 start by having to assign the locations of their ships on the board.  After player 1 assigns all 5 ships in their fleet (a total of 17 hitpoints), their grid will be covered in black ‘fog of war’ and a 5 second counter starts for player 2 to get ready to assign their ships on their grid.  Once player 2 assigns all their ships, the game covers their grid as well in black ‘fog of war’ and a 5 second counter starts for player 1 to start the game.

The player 1 selects the black square the square returns a hit with 'green border’ (background image turns to a ship getting hit) or a miss 'red border.’ After 2 seconds, the current player's grid will turn black and  receive the black ’fog of war.' Then a 5 second counter is set for the next player to get ready.  Once the timer reaches zero, the next player will see their own board but will not be able to see their opponent’s grid. (‘Fog of war’ maybe be set to a picture of a ship but have not decided on if the graph will affect visibility of the darken board). Whichever player sinks all the opponent’s ships ( total of 17 ) wins.  There is no issues of ties.

Possible Challenges
-preventing the player from taking a large ship like a carrier (5 hit points) and purposely breaking the ship and spreading the location

-using JS to build the each 100 square boards and assigning a letter/number for each player’s grid then using a listener function listens to multiple spots and tracks the players

-fixing the class order for the ‘fog of war’ and borders for ‘hit’ and ‘miss’

-avoiding writing excessive code that makes it confusing to debug

Possible Additional Features
-if time permits, an option to play as Donald Trump or Kim Jong Un in the Battle for the East Sea.

-if time permits, an option to play as the Royal Fleet or the Iron Fleet in the Ironbound Rebellion (background and ships will have to turn to reflect time period)

-attempt to fit in a score keeper
